  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including using the Shell for task automation, Git/GitHub
  for version control, and basic to intermediate Python
  programming skills.
  
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
